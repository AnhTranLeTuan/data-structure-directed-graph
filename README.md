# Data Structure: Directed Graph

## Description
Experiment with concepts of directed graph. In this project, we can see how:
* Create the private Node class and override its equals() and hashcode() to be able to compare two nodes in the future
* Create attributes of the directed graph
* Design this graph based on the adjacency list instead of the adjacency array
* Add a node into the graph
* Add an edge or the connection between two nodes to the graph
* Remove a node from the graph
* Remove an edge from the graph
* Depth first traversal based on recursion
* Depth first traversal based on iteration (utilize stack)
* Breadth first traversal based on iteration (utilize queue)
* Topological sorting which is to return a list of elements in a specific order (this algorithm will only work in the graph without the cycle)
* Detect the cycle in the graph
